        <p>Insights about the data/visualization:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The diagram presents a spiral timeline of new COVID-19 cases in the
            United States, measured as a 7-day moving average over multiple
            years (2020, 2021, and 2022).
          </li>
          <li>
            The largest peak is observed in January 2022, indicating the highest
            recorded number of new cases during this period.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cyclical shape suggests seasonal or periodic trends, with
            noticeable waves occurring around similar times each year.
          </li>
          <li>
            The thickness of the bands represents uncertainty or variability,
            highlighting periods with more volatile case counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            The overall trend shows increasing case numbers year over year, with
            2022 having the highest recorded numbers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Design Critique:</p>

        <ul>
          <p>
            This visualization demonstrates both notable strengths and
            opportunities for improvement in its design choices. The spiral
            format serves as an elegant solution for comparing three years of
            data while maintaining temporal continuity through the pandemic. By
            using a black line for the 7-day average alongside red shading to
            show the daily range of cases, the visualization effectively
            communicates both the overall trends and day-to-day variability. The
            clear labeling of years and key months helps orient readers within
            the timeline, while the compact format successfully condenses three
            years of daily data into a single, readable graphic. The design is
            visually striking and likely to capture reader attention, making
            complex epidemiological data more approachable.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, several aspects of the design could be enhanced to improve
            clarity and accessibility. While innovative, the spiral format may
            present an initial challenge for general audiences who are more
            accustomed to traditional linear timelines. The scale showing 0-150K
            cases appears only at the beginning of the spiral, making it
            difficult for readers to gauge values throughout the visualization.
            The addition of more gridlines or reference points could help
            readers track values across the spiral's progression. Furthermore,
            while months are marked on the visualization, not all are labeled,
            requiring readers to mentally count through unmarked months to
            determine specific timeframes. A legend explaining the distinction
            between the red shading and black line would provide helpful context
            for readers. The starting point in October, while logical given the
            pandemic's timeline, isn't immediately obvious and could benefit
            from clearer marking.

        <h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/circle.png" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            Cyclical trends in COVID-19 cases from 2020 to 2022, highlighting
            seasonal surges. Each bar represents monthly case counts, with the
            outer shaded region indicating uncertainty. Peaks in cases align
            with known pandemic waves, showing recurring spikes during winter
            months.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rationale: A circular representation maintains the cyclical nature
            of the data while improving clarity compared to a spiral graph. This
            approach reinforces seasonality, making it more intuitive for
            understanding recurring trends in COVID-19 case surges.
            Additionally, it preserves the overall structure while avoiding the
            distortions that can occur with linear scaling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation: Unlike a traditional line graph, a radial bar chart
            makes it easier to compare peaks across cycles, such as identifying
            winter surges year-over-year. The outward extension of higher case
            counts and inward positioning of lower case counts create a natural,
            intuitive visual interpretation of periodic trends. This design
            highlights seasonal patterns while maintaining clarity in peak
            fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengths: The cyclical structure aids interpretation, aligning
            naturally with seasonal outbreaks and periodic patterns. It also
            enables direct peak comparison, making it easier to observe how
            cases fluctuate across different years. Moreover, the visual appeal
            of the format makes it more engaging and less overwhelming than a
            cluttered line chart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limitations: Uncertainty shading is less effective, as overlaying a
            range on radial bars is more challenging. Precise values are harder
            to read, requiring users to estimate based on radial distances.
            Additionally, the format is less common, meaning some audiences may
            struggle with interpretation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future Exploration: Future improvements could involve adjusting bar
            heights or thickness for readability, incorporating color gradients
            to encode uncertainty or trend strength, and overlaying additional
            context such as major public health events. Exploring alternative
            cyclical formats, like spiral bar charts or rose diagrams, could
            further enhance clarity and interpretation.
          </li>
        </ul>

            Estimated COVID-19 Trends Over Time with an Uncertainty Range. The
            red line represents the estimated case trend, while the shaded
            region shows the possible variation.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rationale: This graph was designed to provide a clear, structured
            representation of COVID-19 case trends over time, serving as a
            translation of a previous spiral graph into a more conventional
            linear time series format. The use of a continuous time axis from
            January 2020 to January 2022 allows for easy tracking of case surges
            and declines. Min-Max normalization was applied to align the case
            counts with the original spiral scale, ensuring a peak case count of
            150K for consistency. Additionally, an uncertainty range (shaded red
            region) was incorporated to reflect potential reporting variability,
            making the visualization more transparent and informative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation: The goal of this visualization was to make COVID-19
            trends more accessible and interpretable while maintaining the key
            insights from the original spiral representation. Unlike a spiral
            graph, which can be visually complex, a linear time series plot
            allows for easy identification of case surges, declines, and overall
            patterns. Furthermore, adding uncertainty visualization acknowledges
            real-world data inaccuracies and enhances trust in the
            representation by communicating the variability in reported cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strength: The visualization effectively conveys clear readability by
            using a familiar time series format, making trends easy to follow.
            Uncertainty shading enhances interpretability by accounting for
            potential data fluctuations, adding credibility to the
            representation. Additionally, the structured approach ensures that
            seasonal waves and major surges can be easily compared without
            unnecessary distortion, making it accessible to a broad audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weakness: One limitation of this approach is that the sinusoidal
            function used to approximate case trends may not fully align with
            real-world surges, which tend to have asymmetric peaks and irregular
            declines. Additionally, the fixed 20% uncertainty margin might not
            be entirely accurate, as uncertainty levels can vary significantly
            depending on external factors such as changes in testing capacity,
            reporting delays, or policy shifts. Lastly, the absence of specific
            contextual annotations, such as lockdowns, vaccine rollouts, or the
            emergence of variants, limits the ability to directly correlate
            trends with real-world events.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future Exploration: To improve upon this visualization, future
            iterations could incorporate real-world COVID-19 data instead of a
            modeled sinusoidal function to ensure accuracy. Additionally, adding
            event-based annotationsâ€”such as marking significant policy
            decisions, variant outbreaks, or vaccine milestonesâ€”could provide
            deeper context. Experimenting with different uncertainty models,
            such as confidence intervals instead of a fixed percentage, could
            further refine the accuracy of the visualization. Lastly, a
            comparison between linear and cyclical representations (such as a
            radial bar chart) could help determine which format better
            communicates seasonal patterns while maintaining clarity.

            Extracted COVID-19 Case Trends from the Original Spiral Graph. This
            visualization preserves real-world fluctuations in daily case
            counts, capturing irregular surges and declines influenced by
            factors such as policy changes, new variants, and testing
            availability
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Rationale: This graph represents the actual extracted case trends
            from the original spiral graph, preserving the real-world
            fluctuations in COVID-19 cases. Rather than smoothing the data, this
            approach retains all peaks, drops, and irregular variations, giving
            a more faithful representation of how case counts evolved over time.
            The use of a linear time axis allows for straightforward
            interpretation and direct comparison of case surges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation: The main motivation behind this visualization was to
            capture the true complexity of COVID-19 trends. Unlike a smoothed
            model, this approach highlights real variations in daily case
            counts, revealing the erratic nature of pandemic waves influenced by
            external factors such as policy interventions, seasonality, and
            variant emergence. By removing assumptions about periodicity, this
            graph allows viewers to analyze the raw data as it was reported.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strength: One of the key strengths of this graph is that it
            maintains real-world data integrity, accurately reflecting actual
            case surges, dips, and irregularities without imposing a simplified
            structure. Unlike a smoothed model, this visualization preserves
            pandemic volatility, capturing rapid fluctuations caused by policy
            shifts, changes in testing availability, and the emergence of new
            variants. Additionally, this format allows for detailed event
            correlation, enabling researchers to overlay key eventsâ€”such as
            lockdowns, new variants, or holidaysâ€”to analyze their direct impact
            on case counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weakness: One major drawback is that the graph is noisy and harder
            to interpret, as the presence of sharp fluctuations may obscure
            long-term trends without additional smoothing. Additionally, it
            lacks explicit uncertainty representation, meaning it does not
            visualize potential reporting errors or confidence intervals, which
            could mislead some viewers about the accuracy of the data. Lastly,
            since the data was extracted from a spiral graph, some minor
            distortions due to data extraction artifacts may require further
            cleaning and validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future Exploration: To improve clarity, a rolling average filter
            could be applied to reduce excessive noise while still preserving
            major case trends. Overlaying real-world event markers such as
            policy restrictions, vaccine milestones, and new variant surges
            could help viewers contextualize fluctuations. Additionally,
            incorporating uncertainty visualizationâ€”such as shaded confidence
            bandsâ€”could enhance accuracy perception and address potential data
            inconsistencies. Finally, comparing this linear extracted format
            with other cyclical representations (e.g., radial bar charts) may
            help determine which format best conveys seasonality and
            fluctuations while maintaining readability.

        <h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/final.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            Radial COVID-19 Timeline: This visualization maps confirmed cases
            (blue), recovered cases (green), and fatality cases (red) over the
            course of the pandemic. Each ring represents a different year,
            reinforcing seasonal patterns and pandemic waves. Circle sizes
            indicate relative case numbers, while key milestones, such as the
            pandemic declaration, vaccine rollout, and major variant surges,
            provide context for fluctuations in case trends.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          This visualization was designed to emphasize the temporal progression
          and seasonal patterns of COVID-19 case metrics while incorporating key
          milestones in the pandemic timeline. By using a radial layout, it
          preserves the cyclical nature of outbreaks, making it easier to
          compare trends across multiple years. The visualization integrates
          three key metricsâ€”confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalitiesâ€”ensuring
          a comprehensive view of pandemic trends. Additionally, the placement
          of major events such as the pandemic declaration, vaccine rollout, and
          variant surges provides critical context, allowing viewers to
          interpret fluctuations in relation to public health interventions. One
          notable design decision was the use of circle sizes to represent
          relative case numbers rather than a heatmap, as previous iterations
          suggested that a heatmap approach might be difficult to follow
          visually, especially when comparing values across multiple months and
          years. The concentric rings help reinforce seasonal trends, making it
          easier to observe recurring waves of COVID-19 while maintaining
          clarity in peak fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This final iteration addresses several challenges identified in
          earlier sketches, particularly in balancing clarity, comparability,
          and interpretability. In Sketch 1, uncertainty was difficult to
          represent effectively within a radial format, and Sketch 2â€™s linear
          time series approach, while clear, failed to emphasize seasonal
          recurrence. By incorporating structured spacing, color-coded
          categories, and milestone markers, this design preserves seasonality
          while enhancing readability. Sketch 3, which relied on real extracted
          data, captured raw fluctuations well but introduced excessive visual
          noise, making long-term patterns harder to interpret. The
          critique-by-redesign process helped refine contextual annotation and
          relative scaling, ensuring that data complexity is preserved without
          overwhelming the viewer. While some trade-offs remain, such as reduced
          precision compared to a standard time series chart, this design
          successfully highlights the cyclical nature and impact of major
          pandemic events in a visually engaging and intuitive format.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          This design process highlighted the challenges of making a clear,
          accurate, and easy-to-read visualization for COVID-19 case trends.
          Early sketches revealed key trade-offs, such as difficulty showing
          uncertainty in a circular format, losing seasonal patterns in a
          standard time series, and too much visual clutter in raw data
          representations. Through multiple refinements, I was able to solve
          these issues by improving the radial format, adding key milestones,
          and using circle sizes instead of a heatmap for better readability.
          The critique-by-redesign approach was essential in figuring out which
          design choices made the data easier to understand and which made it
          more confusing. While this version still has some challenges in
          showing exact values, it effectively captures seasonal trends,
          provides important context, and allows for easy comparison across
          years, showing how valuable iterative design is in data visualization.
