      <h2>Proposition: The NYPD disproportionately receives complaints from Black individuals, suggesting the presence of racial bias in policing.</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/raceprecinct.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            This visualization shows the distribution of complaints by ethnicity across NYPD precincts, with each panel representing a different ethnic group. The height of the bars indicates the percentage of total complaints filed per precinct, allowing for a direct comparison of complaint patterns across groups. Variations in distribution highlight differences in where and how often complaints are filed across precincts.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Using Bar Charts for Comparison -- Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale:

Instead of overlaying all ethnic groups in a single graph, the data is split into separate subplots for each group.
This allows for direct and independent comparisons across different ethnicities without visual overlap.
              </li>
              <li>
				Persuasive Effect:

				Prevents one group from dominating the chart, ensuring that each distribution is given equal visual weight.
				Makes disparities clearer, as complaint variations are isolated per ethnicity.
              </li>
			  <li>What Worked:

				The side-by-side comparison across multiple panels makes it easy to see trends per ethnic group without interference.</li>
              <li>What Didn’t Work:

				Some viewers may prefer a single combined chart to see all distributions at once.</li>
				<li>
					Alternative Considered:

					Stacked bar charts or density plots were considered but would have made it harder to isolate individual group patterns.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Normalizing Complaints as Percentages Instead of Raw Counts --
            Score: 2(Fully Earnest)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale:

Instead of showing raw complaint counts, I transformed the data so it is normalized as percentages of total complaints per precinct.
This avoids misinterpretation due to differences in precinct size or total complaints filed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Persuasive Effect:

This ensures that precincts with large populations do not automatically appear more problematic simply due to higher numbers.
The visualization accurately highlights proportional differences instead of misleading raw counts.
              </li>
			  <li>
				What Worked:

Fairer comparisons across precincts, making the complaint rates per ethnic group more meaningful.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				What Didn’t Work:

Some viewers might misinterpret percentages as absolute numbers, requiring additional clarification.
			  </li>
              <li>
                Alternative Considered: Using raw counts would have made
                high-population precincts look disproportionately problematic,
                which would have been misleading.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Using Different Color Maps for Each Ethnic Group -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly
            Earnest)

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale: Assigning a distinct color for each ethnic group
                ensures clear differentiation and prevents confusion between
                categories. A heat-based color scheme (e.g., Reds for Black
                complaints, Blues for White complaints) emphasizes higher
                complaint rates in an intuitive way.
              </li>
              <li>
                Persuasive Effect:

Improves clarity by ensuring each ethnicity is immediately recognizable.
Draws attention to differences in complaint distributions across precincts.
              </li>
			  <li>
				What Worked:

The color coding prevents confusion and enhances pattern recognition.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				What did not work: Some colorblind viewers may struggle to differentiate colors, though accessibility-friendly palettes were considered.
			  </li>
              <li>
                Alternatives Considered: A monochrome scheme was tested, but it made it harder to compare ethnic distributions effectively.
              </li>
            </ul> </ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Filtering Out Ethnicities with No Data -- Score: 1 (Mostly Earnest)
	  
				  <ul>
					<li>
						Rationale: Avoiding empty subplots improves clarity and prevents misleading gaps in the visualization. Displaying empty charts would have suggested missing data rather than simply a lack of complaints from certain ethnic groups.
					</li>
					<li>
						Persuasive Effect: This removes unnecessary distractions, making the visualization more focused and interpretable.

					</li>
					<li> 
						What Worked:

The visualization is clearer and more focused, as it does not include meaningless empty spaces.
					</li>
					<li>
						What did not work: Some might argue that keeping all the ethnicities would provide a fuller view of complaint trends, even if some had no data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Alternative Considered: Keeping all ethnicities in the visualization could have provided a full view, but it would have included blank or nearly blank plots, leading to confusion.

					</li>
				  </ul> </ul>
				  <ul>
					<li>
						Omitting a Direct Population Baseline for Context -- Score: -0.5 (Slightly Deceptive)

		  
					  <ul>
						<li>
							Rationale: The visualization does not include total precinct population data for context. While it shows percentage-based complaints, it does not indicate whether those percentages align with the general precinct population distribution.

						</li>
						<li>
							Persuasive Effect: This omission could make some precincts look disproportionately problematic when the percentage of complaints may simply reflect local demographics.
	
						</li>
						<li>
							What Worked:

Simplifies the visualization and keeps it focused on complaint rates based on ethinicities rather than broader demographic data.
						</li>
						<li>
							What Didn’t Work:

Without population data, some precincts may appear to have high complaint rates that are actually proportional to their demographics
						</li>
						<li>
							Alternative Considered: Adding demographic data per precinct would provide deeper context but also risk cluttering the visualization. Instead, a separate reference chart for demographic baselines could be included.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/finalll.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
          <figcaption>
            This chart compares actual (red) vs. expected (blue) complaint rates
            by ethnicity, highlighting disparities where actual complaints
            exceed expectations.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
			<li>
				Transforming Data by Calculating Expected Complaint Rates Based on Population -- Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					Instead of comparing raw complaint counts, I calculated the expected number of complaints for each ethnic group based on their estimated population proportions:
					White: 35%, Black: 30%, Hispanic: 25%, Asian: 8%, Other: 2%.
					This ensures that complaints are analyzed in a fair, proportional manner, rather than being influenced by differences in total population size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					This transformation prevents misleading interpretations, where a group might seem to file more complaints simply due to a larger population.
					By comparing actual vs. expected complaints, the chart highlights disparities in police interactions across ethnic groups.  
				</li>
				<li>
					What Worked:

It makes the analysis more objective, ensuring that disparities are not just a result of differing population sizes.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:

						Some viewers may not immediately understand how expected complaints were calculated, requiring explanation.</li>
						
						<li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Using raw complaint counts, but that would favor larger population groups and skew perceptions of police interactions.
				</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
			  Using Bar Charts for Comparison -- Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					A bar chart is an intuitive way to compare actual vs. expected complaint rates.
					The side-by-side bars make disparities immediately visible, helping viewers quickly identify which groups file more or fewer complaints than expected.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					The straightforward visual comparison makes it easy to see overrepresentation or underrepresentation at a glance.  
				</li>
				<li>What Worked:

					Bars clearly show where actual complaints exceed or fall below expectations, making the disparities obvious.</li>
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
						What Didn’t Work:

						Small differences might not be as noticeable compared to other visualization types like a scatter plot.</li>
				  <li>
					Alternative Considered:

					A scatter plot was considered, but it would require more interpretation effort from the viewer.</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Color Choices: Red for Actual Complaints, Blue for Expected -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					Red emphasizes actual complaints, drawing attention to where complaints exceed expectations.
					Blue serves as a neutral reference point, representing what would be expected if complaints were proportional to population size.
					This subtly guides the viewer’s focus without misleading them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					The contrast between red and blue makes disparities pop, helping the viewer immediately recognize gaps between actual and expected rates.
				</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Viewers can instantly see which groups file more complaints than expected.
					The color contrast improves clarity and engagement without making the visualization feel biased.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
				  Some viewers might find the red and blue color deceptive as it tends to geared towards harm or danger
				</li>
				  <li>
					  Alternative Considered:

Using only shades of gray to be more neutral, but that would reduce clarity and make it harder to distinguish actual vs. expected complaints.
	</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Emphasizing That Complaint Percentages Are Small in General -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
				  Rationale:
  
				  The visualization implicitly shows that only a small percentage of people from any ethnic group file complaints.
				  Even though disparities exist, the highest rates remain within a limited percentage range.
				</li>
				<li>
				  Persuasive Effect:
  
				  This prevents viewers from misinterpreting the chart to mean that most people in any group are filing complaints.
It keeps the discussion focused on rate disparities rather than absolute numbers
</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Maintains a balanced perspective, ensuring that the takeaway isn’t exaggerated.
						<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
							Some viewers might still assume the rates reflect all interactions, rather than just reported complaints.
							  <li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Adding an explicit population reference to reinforce this idea, but that would clutter the graph
							</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Sorting Ethnic Groups in a Logical Order (Opposing the Proposition) -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
				  Rationale:
  
				  Instead of sorting from lowest to highest complaint rates, the ethnic groups are sorted in a way that de-emphasizes the narrative of racial disparities in complaints.
				  This reduces the immediate visual impact of overrepresentation in any particular group by preventing a natural progression of increasing complaint rates.
				</li>
				<li>
				  Persuasive Effect:
  
				  The lack of a clear increasing trend makes disparities less obvious, making it harder to immediately conclude that a certain ethnic group is disproportionately filing more complaints.
Viewers may struggle to quickly recognize which groups exceed their expected complaint rates since the order does not directly emphasize the largest gaps
</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Creates a more neutral and less suggestive visualization, preventing the reinforcement of any preconceived narratives about racial disparities.
					Maintains an objective approach by avoiding explicit visual storytelling that could be seen as biased.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
						The lack of a structured order might confuse viewers, especially those expecting a natural ranking (e.g., ascending/descending complaint rates or alphabetical order).
						Viewers might have to examine each bar individually rather than immediately spotting trends.
						 <li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Alphabetical sorting was considered, as it would maintain neutrality, but it wouldn't provide insight into complaint rate differences.
Sorting by the difference between actual and expected complaints was also considered, as it would highlight the most overrepresented groups, making disparities clearer.
