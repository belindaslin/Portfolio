      <h2>Proposition: The NYPD disproportionately receives complaints from Black individuals, suggesting the presence of racial bias in policing.</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/BEESWARM.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
          <figcaption>
            This visualization shows the distribution of complaints by ethnicity across NYPD precincts, with each panel representing a different ethnic group. The height of the bars indicates the percentage of total complaints filed per precinct, allowing for a direct comparison of complaint patterns across groups. Variations in distribution highlight differences in where and how often complaints are filed across precincts. However, this visualization is deceptive because it only consists of precincts with majority black complaints.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
			Using a Hexagonal Stacked Circle Layout -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale: Instead of using a bar or scatter plot, the visualization arranges small circles in a beehive-style hexagonal formation to represent the number of complaints per ethnic group. This layout makes it easy to compare differences while maintaining an engaging and visually appealing structure.
			  </li>
              <li>
				Persuasive Effect: The hexagonal stacking provides a sense of structure while preventing overlap, ensuring that complaint distributions are clearly visible.
              </li>
			  <li>What Worked: The format makes it easy to visually compare different groups without excessive clutter.
				<li>What Didn’t Work: Some viewers unfamiliar with this format may find it harder to interpret than traditional bar charts.
					<li>
						Alternative Considered: A bar chart was considered for a more conventional approach but was rejected because it lacks the visual impact and engagement of a beehive structure.
					   </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Filtering Data to Only Include Precincts with High Black Complaint Rates -- Score: -2 (Fully Deceptive)
			  <ul>
				<li>
				  Rationale:
				  This visualization only includes precincts where Black complaint rates are significantly higher, completely removing precincts where complaints are more evenly distributed among ethnic groups.
				  By excluding precincts with lower Black complaint rates, the visualization amplifies the appearance of racial disparities without showing the full dataset.
 </li>
				<li>
				  Persuasive Effect:
  
				  Viewers only see precincts where Black complaints are dominant, which could mislead them into believing that all precincts follow this pattern.
This strongly supports the proposition but at the cost of fairness, as it selectively removes data that might contradict the narrative.
</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Effectively emphasizes racial disparities in complaints by only showing cases where Black individuals file significantly more complaints.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
						Misleading by omission—viewers are not given the full picture, meaning they might overestimate the degree of disparity across all precincts. </li>
						 <li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Including all precincts for a more balanced comparison, but that would reduce the persuasive impact of the argument.
					</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transforming the Data to Scale Complaint Counts -- 
Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale: The raw data contained individual complaints per ethnic group. To make a fair comparison, I transformed the data by scaling the complaint counts into proportional groupings and then representing them with hexagonally arranged circles. This ensures that each ethnicity is represented fairly based on its relative complaint frequency.
              </li>
              <li>
                Persuasive Effect: The transformation ensures that the visual representation accurately reflects complaint distributions without exaggeration. It also allows for easy pattern recognition without numerical confusion.
              </li>
			  <li>
				What Worked: By normalizing and structuring the data into scaled groupings, the visualization effectively conveys disparities in complaint rates.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				What Didn’t Work: The choice of visual stacking may still give an exaggerated impression of differences.
			  </li>
              <li>
                Alternative Considered: Using raw numbers instead of scaling, but that would make the comparison less visually intuitive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Using Different Color Maps for Each Ethnic Group -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly
            Earnest)

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rationale: Assigning a distinct color for each ethnic group
                ensures clear differentiation and prevents confusion between
                categories. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Persuasive Effect:

Improves clarity by ensuring each ethnicity is immediately recognizable.
Draws attention to differences in complaint distributions across NYC.
              </li>
			  <li>
				What Worked:

The color coding prevents confusion and enhances pattern recognition.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				What did not work: Some colorblind viewers may struggle to differentiate colors, though accessibility-friendly palettes were considered.
			  </li>
              <li>
                Alternatives Considered: A monochrome scheme was tested, but it made it harder to compare ethnic distributions effectively.
              </li>
            </ul> </ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Filtering Out Ethnicities with No Data -- Score: 1 (Mostly Earnest)
	  
				  <ul>
					<li>
						Rationale: Avoiding empty subplots improves clarity and prevents misleading gaps in the visualization. Displaying empty charts would have suggested missing data rather than simply a lack of complaints from certain ethnic groups.
					</li>
					<li>
						Persuasive Effect: This removes unnecessary distractions, making the visualization more focused and interpretable.

					</li>
					<li> 
						What Worked:

The visualization is clearer and more focused, as it does not include meaningless empty spaces.
					</li>
					<li>
						What did not work: Some might argue that keeping all the ethnicities would provide a fuller view of complaint trends, even if some had no data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Alternative Considered: Keeping all ethnicities in the visualization could have provided a full view, but it would have included blank or nearly blank plots, leading to confusion.

					</li>
				  </ul> </ul>
				  <ul>
					<li>
						Omitting a Direct Population Baseline for Context -- Score: -1 (Slightly Deceptive)

		  
					  <ul>
						<li>
							Rationale: The visualization only represents the percentage of total complaints filed by each ethnic group in selected precincts but does not include data on the overall number of interactions or incidents in those precincts.
							While the chart accurately shows the distribution of complaints by ethnicity, it does not account for how frequently different groups interact with law enforcement or the total number of complaints relative to all police interactions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Persuasive Effect: By excluding broader complaint totals, the visualization may make some precincts appear disproportionately problematic, when in reality, their complaint rates could be proportional to the overall number of police interactions in those areas.
							This omission reinforces the focus on disparities without providing the full context of total complaints vs. total law enforcement encounters.
						</li>
						<li>
							What Worked:

							Simplifies the visualization and keeps the focus strictly on complaint rates per ethnicity rather than broader law enforcement statistics.
							Allows for direct comparison of how complaints are distributed across groups, without adding extra layers of data that might dilute the message.</li>
						<li>
							What Didn’t Work:

							Lacks full context, meaning that viewers do not see whether high complaint percentages are due to more frequent interactions with police or a true disparity in complaints per interaction.
							Some precincts may appear to have disproportionately high complaint rates when they may simply have higher overall police activity.</li>
						<li>
							Alternative Considered: Adding a reference chart showing total complaints per precinct, which would provide more context about complaint volume relative to total law enforcement encounters.
							Including additional data on police interactions by ethnicity, but this could introduce complexity and require assumptions about interaction frequency.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/finalll.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
          <figcaption>
            This chart compares actual (red) vs. expected (blue) complaint rates
            by ethnicity, highlighting disparities where actual complaints
            exceed expectations.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
			<li>
				Transforming Data by Calculating Expected Complaint Rates Based on Population -- Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					Instead of comparing raw complaint counts, I calculated the expected number of complaints for each ethnic group based on their estimated population proportions:
					White: 35%, Black: 30%, Hispanic: 25%, Asian: 8%, Other: 2%.
					This ensures that complaints are analyzed in a fair, proportional manner, rather than being influenced by differences in total population size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					This transformation prevents misleading interpretations, where a group might seem to file more complaints simply due to a larger population.
					By comparing actual vs. expected complaints, the chart highlights disparities in police interactions across ethnic groups.  
				</li>
				<li>
					What Worked:

It makes the analysis more objective, ensuring that disparities are not just a result of differing population sizes.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:

						Some viewers may not immediately understand how expected complaints were calculated, requiring explanation.</li>
						
						<li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Using raw complaint counts, but that would favor larger population groups and skew perceptions of police interactions.
				</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
			  Using Bar Charts for Comparison -- Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					A bar chart is an intuitive way to compare actual vs. expected complaint rates.
					The side-by-side bars make disparities immediately visible, helping viewers quickly identify which groups file more or fewer complaints than expected.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					The straightforward visual comparison makes it easy to see overrepresentation or underrepresentation at a glance.  
				</li>
				<li>What Worked:

					Bars clearly show where actual complaints exceed or fall below expectations, making the disparities obvious.</li>
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
						What Didn’t Work:

						Small differences might not be as noticeable compared to other visualization types like a scatter plot.</li>
				  <li>
					Alternative Considered:

					A scatter plot was considered, but it would require more interpretation effort from the viewer.</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Color Choices: Red for Actual Complaints, Blue for Expected -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
					Rationale:

					Red emphasizes actual complaints, drawing attention to where complaints exceed expectations.
					Blue serves as a neutral reference point, representing what would be expected if complaints were proportional to population size.
					This subtly guides the viewer’s focus without misleading them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Persuasive Effect:

					The contrast between red and blue makes disparities pop, helping the viewer immediately recognize gaps between actual and expected rates.
				</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Viewers can instantly see which groups file more complaints than expected.
					The color contrast improves clarity and engagement without making the visualization feel biased.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
				  Some viewers might find the red and blue color deceptive as it tends to geared towards harm or danger
				</li>
				  <li>
					  Alternative Considered:

Using only shades of gray to be more neutral, but that would reduce clarity and make it harder to distinguish actual vs. expected complaints.
	</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Emphasizing That Complaint Percentages Are Small in General -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
				  Rationale:
  
				  The visualization implicitly shows that only a small percentage of people from any ethnic group file complaints.
				  Even though disparities exist, the highest rates remain within a limited percentage range.
				</li>
				<li>
				  Persuasive Effect:
  
				  This prevents viewers from misinterpreting the chart to mean that most people in any group are filing complaints.
It keeps the discussion focused on rate disparities rather than absolute numbers
</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Maintains a balanced perspective, ensuring that the takeaway isn’t exaggerated.
						<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
							Some viewers might still assume the rates reflect all interactions, rather than just reported complaints.
							  <li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Adding an explicit population reference to reinforce this idea, but that would clutter the graph
							</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul>
			<li>
				Sorting Ethnic Groups in a Logical Order (Opposing the Proposition) -- Score: 1.5 (Mostly Earnest)
			  <ul>
				<li>
				  Rationale:
  
				  Instead of sorting from lowest to highest complaint rates, the ethnic groups are sorted in a way that de-emphasizes the narrative of racial disparities in complaints.
				  This reduces the immediate visual impact of overrepresentation in any particular group by preventing a natural progression of increasing complaint rates.
				</li>
				<li>
				  Persuasive Effect:
  
				  The lack of a clear increasing trend makes disparities less obvious, making it harder to immediately conclude that a certain ethnic group is disproportionately filing more complaints.
Viewers may struggle to quickly recognize which groups exceed their expected complaint rates since the order does not directly emphasize the largest gaps
</li>
				<li>What Worked:
  
					Creates a more neutral and less suggestive visualization, preventing the reinforcement of any preconceived narratives about racial disparities.
					Maintains an objective approach by avoiding explicit visual storytelling that could be seen as biased.
					<li>What Didn’t Work:
  
						The lack of a structured order might confuse viewers, especially those expecting a natural ranking (e.g., ascending/descending complaint rates or alphabetical order).
						Viewers might have to examine each bar individually rather than immediately spotting trends.
						 <li>
					  Alternative Considered:
  
					  Alphabetical sorting was considered, as it would maintain neutrality, but it wouldn't provide insight into complaint rate differences.
Sorting by the difference between actual and expected complaints was also considered, as it would highlight the most overrepresented groups, making disparities clearer.
</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>One of the most straightforward parts of the design process was normalizing the data to allow for a fair comparison of complaint rates across ethnic groups. Converting raw counts into proportions ensured that larger groups did not appear to file more complaints simply due to population size. Additionally, using color coding for each ethnicity was an intuitive way to differentiate categories, making the visualization easy to interpret.

			However, the most challenging aspect was deciding which transformations were ethical and which could be misleading. For instance, selectively filtering precincts to only show those with high Black complaint rates strongly reinforced the proposition but at the cost of fairness, as it removed precincts where complaints were more evenly distributed. Similarly, omitting a direct population baseline shaped perception by making disparities seem more extreme, even though the data itself was accurate.
			
			What surprised me most was how small design choices—such as ordering categories, adjusting scales, or using different chart types—could significantly shift how people interpret the data. This reinforced that visualization is not just about showing data but also about shaping perception.
			
			I now define ethical analysis and visualization as the process of ensuring that visual choices do not misrepresent data or obscure key context. However, the line between "acceptable" persuasion and "misleading" manipulation is not always clear. The key ethical boundary lies in whether a visualization intentionally distorts reality or withholds critical context. The most responsible approach is to provide transparency—whether through captions, footnotes, or supplementary visualizations—to ensure that viewers understand both what they see and what they don’t.
