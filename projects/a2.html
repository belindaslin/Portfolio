        <h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords and Evictions</h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When did significant rises in housing construction occur, and what
            factors might explain these surges?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Housing construction patterns often respond to broader economic, social, and policy-driven shifts. Periods of rapid homebuilding often align with population growth, economic booms, large-scale infrastructure projects, or shifts in housing policy—conditions that can create opportunities for corporate landlords to enter the market, capitalize on newly built properties, and expand their portfolios during housing booms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence:The New York Times article noted that corporate investors
              often enter housing markets during periods of increased
              construction activity, particularly when new housing supply is
              expected to yield long-term returns. The Housing Justice Report
              highlighted how post-World War II housing booms and more recent
              construction waves have shifted ownership patterns—with corporate
              acquisitions becoming more prevalent in recent decades.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Which neighborhoods have the highest corporate ownership rates?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Understanding which neighborhoods have high corporate
              ownership rates is essential for assessing potential risks of
              housing instability. Research indicates that corporate landlords
              are often more likely to displace tenants than individual
              landlords. By identifying these neighborhoods, we can better
              understand corporate influence on housing patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence: The New York Times article (2023) found that corporate
              landlords across the U.S. have filed evictions at
              disproportionately high rates, especially in low-income
              neighborhoods. Corporate ownership often coincides with increased
              tenant turnover, as companies apply profit-driven property
              management practices. The Housing Justice Report highlighted that
              corporate acquisitions in Massachusetts were often followed by
              rent increases and tenant displacements, particularly in
              communities with historically stable ownership patterns.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            What types of properties have the highest number of flipped
            properties, and how might this relate to potential eviction
            patterns?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Frequent property flipping can indicate higher tenant
              turnover and potential eviction risks, especially when corporate
              landlords seek to renovate and reprice units. This analysis can
              reveal whether specific property types are disproportionately
              targeted in neighborhoods with high corporate ownership rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence: New York Times Article (2023) mentioned that corporate
              landlords often target apartment-style properties like
              condominiums and multi-family buildings due to their high turnover
              potential. Eviction filings are sometimes used as a strategic tool
              to clear units for renovations and rent increases. Condominiums
              and multi-family buildings are highlighted as prime targets for
              corporate investment. Housing Justice Report (MIT & Homes for All
              MA) found that eviction filings spiked in neighborhoods where
              corporate acquisitions increased—particularly in multi-family
              housing units. Post-COVID investor activity disproportionately
              targeted rental properties in low-income, minority-majority
              neighborhoods, often followed by turnover surges.

            The first step of my analysis involves examining the dataset to
            understand the distribution of houses built each year. During this
            process, I observed an unusual anomaly: some houses are listed as
            being constructed before or during year 0. This discrepancy likely
            results from Tableau's handling of missing data, where placeholder
            values like -1 or 0 may have been assigned to represent unknown
            years. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of this analysis, I will
            filter the data to include only houses built after 1798, as these
            years account for the majority of the recorded construction
            activity. A revised version of the graph, reflecting this
            adjustment, is presented under the first graph.

          <figcaption>
            After addressing some of the data quality issues, I sought to
            identify the specific areas where the majority of houses were being
            built. The graph illustrates the number of homes constructed across
            various communities in Massachusetts, with 02112 leading, followed
            by 02113, 02215, 02118, and 02115. The remaining ZIP codes and
            neighborhoods show relatively similar numbers, with fewer homes
            built overall. Notably, most of these high-activity ZIP codes are
            concentrated in the Greater Boston Area, within the New England
            Census Division. I began to wonder: Why are certain neighborhoods
            seeing more growth than others? This question prompted me to dig
            deeper into potential historical contexts of the area. Upon
            investigation, I found that this pattern aligns with historical
            trends, as the Greater Boston Area experienced significant
            urbanization during the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by
            immigration waves, the region's development as a major commercial
            hub, and also the post-World War II housing boom.

            For each of the major neighborhoods, I wanted to investigate the differences between self-owned occupancy rates and corporate ownership rates. To achieve this, I created a gradient on each bar to visually highlight the distinction between the two measures. The gradient provides a clearer representation of how ownership dynamics vary across neighborhoods, making it easier to identify patterns and outliers. This chart also reveals that, while most neighborhoods predominantly consist of self-owned homes, there are exceptions where corporate-owned housing rates closely match self-occupancy rates, such as in neighborhoods like Fenway and Longwood, which also have two of the highest corporate-own rate.

          <figcaption>
           <p> While analyzing which types of neighborhoods had the highest number of flipped homes within a 2-year period, I sorted the data in descending order—from the neighborhoods with the most flipped homes to those with the least. This sorting allowed me to clearly identify patterns and trends across neighborhoods based on their level of flipping activity. Through this process, I observed an intriguing pattern: neighborhoods with higher numbers of flipped properties tend to have higher corporate ownership rates.
			</p><p>This observation prompted me to ask a follow-up question: Is there a relationship between corporate ownership rates and flipping activity across different neighborhoods? The descending sort provided a clear visualization of this potential relationship, as corporate-owned properties appeared more frequently toward the top of the sorted list, where flipping activity was the highest. This suggests that corporate buyers might be actively participating in markets with high turnover and frequent property flipping, potentially contributing to housing instability and increased eviction rates in these areas.</p>
			<p></p>I initially considered creating a scatter plot to compare corporate ownership rates with the number of flipped properties. However, the data required for this analysis was spread across two distinct datasets with differing numbers of data points and variables, making it difficult to create a meaningful scatterplot. Despite this challenge, when comparing the graphs titled "Corporate vs. Owner-Occupancy Rate in Different Neighborhoods" and "Summary of Flipped Homes in Different Neighborhoods", a general positive correlation appears to emerge. For example, neighborhoods like Fenway and Longwood, which had some of the highest numbers of corporate-owned properties, also showed a high number of flipped homes.
			<p></p>That said, this observed relationship should be interpreted with caution. The "Corporate vs. Owner-Occupancy Rate in Different Neighborhoods" chart contained significantly fewer data points than the "Summary of Flipped Homes in Different Neighborhoods" chart, which may introduce discrepancies and make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.

				I wanted to further investigate the relationship between possible evictions and corporate property ownership, so I transformed the data to include a new column that represents the average number of buyer purchases across all corporations—such as banks, trusts, and LLCs. This transformation allowed me to measure corporate buying activity as a whole and analyze its relationship with flipping activity and the original locations of these houses. Through this analysis, I found that the average number of corporate purchases tends to be higher in neighborhoods with increased new construction and flipping activity. In these areas, corporate investors often enter the market to capitalize on potential profits, purchasing properties in bulk, flipping them, and reselling or renting them at higher prices. As corporate ownership grows, eviction rates often follow, as tenants are displaced due to rising rents or property turnover. This pattern suggests a strong link between corporate purchasing patterns, flipping activity, and eviction dynamics in rapidly developing neighborhoods.

          <figcaption>
            <p>To address the final question—"What types of properties are most commonly flipped, and how does this relate to eviction activity?"—I analyzed the data using a Packed Bubble Chart after filtering the dataset to focus specifically on flipped properties. This step ensured that only properties with a flip horizon of less than 2 years were included, allowing for more precise insights into short-term flipping activity. The results indicate that condominiums are the most commonly flipped within this period. To improve the clarity of the analysis, I filtered the data further to include only the top 5 property usage types, as the remaining categories were not statistically significant.

			</p><p>This finding aligns with insights from a New York Times article, which noted that apartment renters—who often reside in investor-owned properties—are more vulnerable to eviction, particularly when facing late or missed rent payments. This trend makes sense when considering the nature of multi-unit properties like condominiums: they tend to experience higher tenant turnover, making them especially attractive to corporate landlords and investors. By flipping these units, landlords can capitalize on rising rental demand, increase property values, and justify rent hikes. Additionally, eviction filings may be strategically used to vacate units for renovations and higher-priced leases, contributing to housing instability in these neighborhoods.

			</p><p>However, during the analysis, I identified potential inconsistencies in the dataset. Specifically, "Condo Bldg" and "Condominium" appeared as separate property types, despite representing similar types of housing. This lack of standardized property labeling could lead to overlapping counts or misleading trends—potentially inflating the perceived flipping activity if both labels refer to similar units but are counted separately.

			</p><p>These data inconsistencies highlight the importance of filtering and cleaning the dataset before conducting further analysis. Moving forward, I plan to apply data cleaning techniques to consolidate similar property types and ensure accurate, reliable insights into the relationship between property flipping and eviction activity across different neighborhoods.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>The analysis revealed several key findings regarding housing construction, corporate ownership, and eviction patterns. Periods of increased housing construction often coincided with population growth, economic booms, and infrastructure projects, providing opportunities for corporate investors to enter the market and expand their portfolios. Neighborhoods with higher numbers of flipped properties tended to have elevated corporate ownership rates, particularly in areas with recent construction activity, such as Fenway and Longwood. This pattern suggests that corporate buyers are actively participating in markets with high property turnover, potentially contributing to housing instability through increased tenant displacement. Additionally, condominiums were identified as the most commonly flipped property type within a 2-year horizon, aligning with research indicating that apartment renters are more vulnerable to eviction. The transformation of the data to include a column for the average number of buyer purchases across corporations revealed that corporate purchases were more concentrated in neighborhoods experiencing construction booms and high flipping activity. However, data inconsistencies, such as the misclassification of similar property types, highlighted the need for data cleaning to ensure more reliable insights into the relationship between corporate ownership, flipping, and eviction patterns.
