        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When did significant rises in housing construction occur, and what
            factors might explain these surges?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Housing construction patterns often reflect broader
              economic, social, and policy-driven shifts. Periods of rapid
              homebuilding may coincide with population growth, economic booms,
              infrastructure projects, or changes in housing policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence:The New York Times article noted that corporate investors
              often enter housing markets during periods of increased
              construction activity, particularly when new housing supply is
              expected to yield long-term returns. The Housing Justice Report
              highlighted how post-World War II housing booms and more recent
              construction waves have shifted ownership patterns—with corporate
              acquisitions becoming more prevalent in recent decades.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Which neighborhoods have the highest corporate ownership rates?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Understanding which neighborhoods have high corporate
              ownership rates is essential for assessing potential risks of
              housing instability. Research indicates that corporate landlords
              are often more likely to displace tenants than individual
              landlords. By identifying these neighborhoods, we can better
              understand corporate influence on housing patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence: The New York Times article (2023) found that corporate
              landlords across the U.S. have filed evictions at
              disproportionately high rates, especially in low-income
              neighborhoods. Corporate ownership often coincides with increased
              tenant turnover, as companies apply profit-driven property
              management practices. The Housing Justice Report highlighted that
              corporate acquisitions in Massachusetts were often followed by
              rent increases and tenant displacements, particularly in
              communities with historically stable ownership patterns.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            What types of properties have the highest number of flipped
            properties, and how might this relate to potential eviction
            patterns?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: Frequent property flipping can indicate higher tenant
              turnover and potential eviction risks, especially when corporate
              landlords seek to renovate and reprice units. This analysis can
              reveal whether specific property types are disproportionately
              targeted in neighborhoods with high corporate ownership rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence: New York Times Article (2023) mentioned that corporate
              landlords often target apartment-style properties like
              condominiums and multi-family buildings due to their high turnover
              potential. Eviction filings are sometimes used as a strategic tool
              to clear units for renovations and rent increases. Condominiums
              and multi-family buildings are highlighted as prime targets for
              corporate investment. Housing Justice Report (MIT & Homes for All
              MA) found that eviction filings spiked in neighborhoods where
              corporate acquisitions increased—particularly in multi-family
              housing units. Post-COVID investor activity disproportionately
              targeted rental properties in low-income, minority-majority
              neighborhoods, often followed by turnover surges.

            The first step of my analysis involves examining the dataset to
            understand the distribution of houses built each year. During this
            process, I observed an unusual anomaly: some houses are listed as
            being constructed before or during year 0. This discrepancy likely
            results from Tableau's handling of missing data, where placeholder
            values like -1 or 0 may have been assigned to represent unknown
            years. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of this analysis, I will
            filter the data to include only houses built after 1798, as these
            years account for the majority of the recorded construction
            activity. A revised version of the graph, reflecting this
            adjustment, is presented under the first graph.

          <img src="./images/map.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            After addressing some of the data quality issues, I sought to
            identify the specific areas where the majority of houses were being
            built. The graph illustrates the number of homes constructed across
            various communities in Massachusetts, with 02112 leading, followed
            by 02113, 02215, 02118, and 02115. The remaining ZIP codes and
            neighborhoods show relatively similar numbers, with fewer homes
            built overall. Notably, most of these high-activity ZIP codes are
            concentrated in the Greater Boston Area, within the New England
            Census Division. I began to wonder: Why are certain neighborhoods
            seeing more growth than others? This question prompted me to dig
            deeper into potential historical contexts of the area. Upon
            investigation, I found that this pattern aligns with historical
            trends, as the Greater Boston Area experienced significant
            urbanization during the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by
            immigration waves, the region's development as a major commercial
            hub, and also the post-World War II housing boom.

          <figcaption>
            For each of the major neighborhoods, I wanted to investigate the
            differences between self-owned occupancy rates and corporate
            ownership rates. To achieve this, I created a gradient on each bar
            to visually highlight the distinction between the two measures. The
            gradient provides a clearer representation of how ownership dynamics
            vary across neighborhoods, making it easier to identify patterns and
            outliers. By applying this gradient, the bars display a continuous
            color shift based on the respective rates, allowing for a more
            intuitive understanding of the data. Darker shades indicate higher
            values, while lighter shades correspond to lower rates. This visual
            approach helps illustrate neighborhoods where corporate ownership is
            more prevalent and those where self-ownership remains dominant. This
            chart also reveals that, while most neighborhoods predominantly
            consist of self-owned homes, there are exceptions where
            corporate-owned housing rates closely match self-occupancy rates,
            such as in neighborhoods like Fenway and Longwood.

            While analyzing which types of neighborhoods had the highest number
            of flipped homes, I observed an intriguing pattern: neighborhoods
            with more flipped properties tend to have higher corporate ownership
            rates. This observation prompted me to ask a follow-up question: Is
            there a relationship between corporate ownership rates and flipping
            activity across different neighborhoods? I initially considered
            creating a scatter plot to compare corporate ownership rates with
            the number of flipped properties. However, the data required for
            this analysis was spread across two distinct datasets with differing
            numbers of data points and variables, making it difficult to create
            a meaningful scatterplot. Despite this challenge, when comparing the
            graphs titled "Corporate vs. Owner-Occupancy Rate in Different
            Neighborhoods" and "Summary of Flipped Homes in Different
            Neighborhoods", a general positive correlation appears to emerge.
            For example, neighborhoods like Fenway and Longwood, which had some
            of the highest numbers of corporate-owned properties, also showed a
            high number of flipped homes. That said, this observed relationship
            should be interpreted with caution. The "Corporate vs.
            Owner-Occupancy Rate in Different Neighborhoods" chart contained
            significantly fewer data points than the "Summary of Flipped Homes
            in Different Neighborhoods" chart, which may introduce discrepancies
            and make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.

          <figcaption>
            To address the final question—"What types of properties are most
            commonly flipped, and how does this relate to eviction activity?"—I
            analyzed the data using a Packed Bubble Chart. The results reveal
            that condominiums are the most frequently flipped property type.
            This observation aligns with findings from the New York Times
            article, which highlighted how apartment renters often occupy spaces
            owned by others, making them more susceptible to
            eviction—particularly in cases of late or missed rent payments. This
            trend makes sense when considering the nature of multi-unit
            properties like condominiums. These properties typically experience
            higher tenant turnover, making them particularly attractive to
            investors and corporate landlords. By flipping these units,
            landlords can capitalize on rental demand, increase property values,
            and justify rent hikes. Additionally, eviction filings may be
            strategically used to clear units for renovations and rent
            increases, further contributing to housing instability. However,
            upon closer examination of the dataset, I observed potential
            inconsistencies in property categorization. For instance, "Condo
            Bldg" and "Condominium" appear as separate property types, despite
            representing similar property uses. This lack of standardized
            labeling could lead to overlaps in analysis or misleading patterns
            when interpreting results. Such discrepancies might inflate the
            perceived flipping activity if both categories refer to similar
            types of housing units but are counted separately. These data inconsistencies highlight the importance of data cleaning and standardization before conducting further analysis. Ensuring that similar property types—like condominiums and condo buildings—are grouped together can prevent double-counting and improve the reliability of insights. Moving forward, I will apply data cleaning techniques to unify property classifications and provide more accurate insights into flipping activity across different neighborhoods.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>This analysis of the dataset revealed significant insights into housing development, corporate ownership, and property flipping patterns in Massachusetts. Key findings include the concentration of new housing development in the Greater Boston Area, particularly during periods of economic growth such as the post-World War II boom. The analysis also uncovered a positive correlation between corporate ownership rates and property flipping activity, with condominiums being the most commonly flipped property type. Inconsistencies in property classifications, such as the distinction between "Condo Bldg" and "Condominium," highlighted the need for better data cleaning. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding property dynamics in relation to corporate ownership and flipping activity. However, the accuracy and depth of this analysis could have been improved with more thorough preprocessing and data transformation.</p>
